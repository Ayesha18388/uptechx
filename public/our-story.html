        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="our-story-content">

            <p>Every great journey starts with a simple idea, and <b>UptechX</b> is no exception. It is founded by two passionate tech enthusiasts,
                 Ayesha Siddiqua and Kulsum Parveen, who envisioned a platform that makes tech education and career opportunities accessible to everyone.</p>
            <h3>How It All Started</h3>
            <p>As students in the tech field, we often struggled to find structured learning resources, scholarships, and hackathon opportunities in one place.
                 The internet was full of scattered information, and we realized that many students faced the same challenge. That’s when we decided to take matters into our own hands and build a platform that serves as a one-stop hub for tech aspirants.</p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We created UptechX with a clear goal: to empower students with free learning resources, real-world opportunities, and the latest tech updates. We believe that education should be accessible, inclusive, and practical, helping learners grow and thrive in their careers.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges & Growth</h3>
            <p>Building UptechX from scratch was no easy task. From designing the platform to coding the website, we faced numerous hurdles. But with determination, long nights of learning, and an unwavering commitment to our vision, we turned our dream into reality. Every challenge strengthened our belief that if you have the passion to create something impactful, nothing is impossible.
            </p>

            <p>Free Courses on trending technologies</p>
            <p>Scholarships & Hackathon updates</p>
            <p>Dsa and aptitude </p>

            <p>Tech news on emerging trends</p>
            <p>A growing community of learners & innovators</p>
       
        <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
        <p>We started UptechX as a passion project, but today, it has become much more—a platform that connects, inspires, and educates. Our journey has just begun, and we are constantly working to enhance UptechX with more resources, features, and opportunities for students worldwide.
